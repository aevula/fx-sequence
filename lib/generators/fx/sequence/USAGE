Description:
  Create a new database sequence for your application. This will create a new
  sequence definition file and the accompanying migration.

  When --no-migration is passed, skips generating a migration.
  When --exact-name is passed, uses exact name without "seq" suffix.

Examples:
    rails generate fx:sequence numbers

      create: db/sequences/numbers_seq_v01.sql
      create: db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_create_sequence_numbers_seq.rb

    rails generate fx:sequence numbers --exact-name

      create: db/sequences/numbers_v01.sql
      create: db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_create_sequence_numbers.rb
